## Abstract
Outdoor air pollution is responsible for a substantial number of premature deaths, severe illnesses, and economic damages. In 2019, according to the Global Burden of Disease, it caused 4.5 (3.62-5.37) million deaths. We can expect air pollution co-benefits from climate change mitigation policies in the next decades. The recent IPCC AR6 report reviews several scenarios that adopt a novel carbon budget approach — the net-zero pathways — which are designed to prevent the temporary overshoot of the 1.5ºC temperature target. We examine if the net-zero pathways can consistently deliver improved air pollution outcomes. Using a global source-receptor air pollution model we estimate the concentrations, health impacts, and economic damages of climate mitigation scenarios.
Moreover, we investigate the primary factors contributing to uncertainty in air pollution mortality and economic damages, as well as how they interact, with particular emphasis on their significance for non-overshooting scenarios. We implement several relative risk functions to estimate the number of premature deaths and a set of functions to derive the economic damage. We conclude that stringent climate policies, keeping well below 2ºC (aiming at 1.5ºC), and avoiding temperature overshoot consistently improve the health and economic co-benefits and reduce the likelihood of high mortality estimates. 
Co-benefits are particularly important for China and India. These results are robust across several air pollution economic damage estimation methods and normative choices. 
Globally, net-zero policies avoid 274 (119-417) thousand premature deaths and 791 (767-821) billion USD2020 economic damages relative to end-of-century policies in 2030.
